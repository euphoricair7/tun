# tun - A Tunneling Application in Go

## Overview
**tun** is a lightweight tunneling application implemented in Go. It facilitates secure and efficient communication between a client and a relay server.

## Directory Structure

```
tun/
├── cmd/
│   ├── server/
│   │   └── main.go       # Entry point for the relay server
│   └── client/
│       └── main.go       # Entry point for the client
├── internal/
│   ├── server/
│   │   └── server.go     # Relay server implementation
│   └── client/
│       └── client.go     # Client implementation
├── pkg/
│   └── protocol/
│       └── protocol.go   # Shared protocol definitions
└── go.mod                # Go module definition
```

### Description of Components
- **`cmd/`**: Contains the main entry points for running the application.
  - **`cmd/server/main.go`**: Starts the relay server.
  - **`cmd/client/main.go`**: Starts the client.
  
- **`internal/`**: Holds the core implementation details for the application.
  - **`internal/server/server.go`**: Implements the logic for the relay server, including connection handling and data routing.
  - **`internal/client/client.go`**: Implements the logic for the client, handling requests and communication with the relay server.
  
- **`pkg/`**: Contains shared packages used across the application.
  - **`pkg/protocol/protocol.go`**: Defines the protocol used for communication between the client and the server, ensuring compatibility and consistent data exchange.
  
- **`go.mod`**: The Go module definition file for dependency management and project configuration.

## Features
- **Secure Tunneling**: Facilitates encrypted data transmission between the client and server.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular directory structure allows for easy extension and maintenance.
- **Shared Protocol Definitions**: Ensures consistency and reliability in client-server communication.



## Requirements
- Go 1.18 or later
- Access to a network environment for client-server communication
